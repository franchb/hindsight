## Failure Cases

### Example 1

**Question**: Can you recommend some recent publications or conferences that I might find interesting?

**Expected Answer**: The user would prefer suggestions related to recent research papers, articles, or conferences that focus on artificial intelligence in healthcare, particularly those that involve deep learning for medical image analysis. They would not be interested in general AI topics or those unrelated to healthcare.

**Model's Answer**: The user would prefer recent publications and conferences that focus on advanced deep learning for medical image analysis—especially multi‑modal image fusion, transfer learning, and domain adaptation—along with explainable AI techniques for visualizing and interpreting medical imaging models, and also topics related to brain‑computer interface decoders and broader neuroscience‑engineering research. They would not prefer publications or conferences that are unrelated to these technical research areas.

**Why Incorrect**: The answer adds unrelated topics (brain‑computer interface, neuroscience‑engineering) that conflict with the user's preference for AI in healthcare and deep learning for medical image analysis.

**Generated Correct Answer**: **What kind of publications / conferences you’re likely to find most useful**

Based on everything you’ve asked about in the past, you seem to be looking for two broad “streams” of information:

| Area of interest (from your past queries) | What you would prefer to read / attend (typical venues, topics, and formats) |
|---|---|
| **Advanced deep‑learning for medical image analysis** (multi‑modal image fusion, transfer learning, domain adaptation, XAI) | • Recent **journal articles** that combine a strong methodological contribution with a clear clinical use‑case (e.g., *IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging*, *Medical Image Analysis*, *Nature Biomedical Engineering*).  <br>• **Conference proceedings** from the top AI‑medical‑imaging meetings where new datasets and benchmark results are presented (e.g., the **MICCAI** annual conference, the **ISBI** symposium, the **CVPR/ICCV** workshops on medical imaging, and the **NeurIPS** or **ICML** workshops on explainable AI for healthcare).  <br>• Short **pre‑print** collections (arXiv “cs.CV” and “eess.IV”) that focus on multi‑modal fusion pipelines, self‑supervised pre‑training for scarce medical data, and adversarial domain‑adaptation techniques. |
| **Explainable AI for medical imaging** (visualisation, saliency, attention, LIME/SHAP) | • Survey‑style **review papers** in the same journals above, plus dedicated **special issues** on XAI in healthcare.  <br>• **Workshops** that pair a demo‑oriented session with a discussion of regulatory/clinical impact (e.g., the “Explainable AI for Medical Imaging” workshop at MICCAI, the “Interpretability in Healthcare” track at NeurIPS). |
| **Brain‑computer‑interface (BCI) decoders & neuro‑engineering** | • High

### Example 2

**Question**: Can you recommend a show or movie for me to watch tonight?

**Expected Answer**: The user would prefer recommendations for stand-up comedy specials on Netflix, especially those that are known for their storytelling. They may not prefer recommendations for other genres or platforms.

**Model's Answer**: The user would prefer shows or movies that feature strong storytelling, such as narrative‑driven comedies, true‑crime dramas, or personal‑development themed content. They would not prefer content that lacks a clear narrative focus.

**Why Incorrect**: The answer does not mention the user's preference for Netflix stand‑up comedy specials and adds unrelated genres.

**Generated Correct Answer**: Based on the topics you’ve asked about in the past, the kind of show or movie that would probably keep you most engaged tonight falls into one (or more) of the following buckets:

1. **Comedy with a strong narrative arc** – You’ve been looking at stand‑up specials that emphasize storytelling (e.g., Hasan Minhaj, Ali Wong, Mike Birbiglia). A feature‑length comedy that builds a clear personal or observational story—think a comedian‑driven film or a sitcom‑style dramedy that mixes humor with genuine life moments—would match that taste.

2. **True‑crime or investigative documentary** – After binge‑listening to “Crime Junkie” and asking for more true‑crime podcasts, you seem drawn to well‑structured, fact‑based narratives that reveal a mystery or a real‑world investigation. A limited‑series or feature documentary that follows a single case, presents interviews, and unpacks the evidence would likely feel satisfying.

3. **Historical or archaeological documentary** – You’ve asked for extra resources on ancient Egypt, the pyramids, and other ancient civilizations. A visually rich documentary (or doc‑drama) that explores the construction of the pyramids, the culture of the Old Kingdom, or a broader look at ancient societies would align with that curiosity.

4. **Light‑hearted food or travel‑themed entertainment** – You’ve shown interest in cooking (Thai cookbooks, healthy oils) and in exploring new places (Denver attractions). A food‑centric travel series, a culinary competition show, or a feel‑good movie that revolves around cooking, market trips, or a road‑trip adventure could hit the spot.

5. **Creative‑process or “making‑art” content** – Since you’re planning to record a comedy video for YouTube and have been experimenting with watercolor texture techniques, a behind‑the‑scenes documentary about a performer, artist, or maker—showing the process, the setbacks, and the breakthroughs—might be both inspiring and enjoyable.

**What to look for when you browse**  

- **Genre + storytelling focus** – Choose titles that advertise “based on true events,” “personal journey,” or “stand‑up special” in the description.  
- **Length** – If you want something quick before bed, aim for a 30‑ to 60‑minute special or a single‑episode documentary. If you have a few hours, a 2‑hour comedy film or a 3‑episode true‑crime mini‑series works well.  
- **Tone** – Since you enjoy both humor and serious investigative work, a show that balances wit with depth (e.g., a comedy‑drama or a true‑crime series with occasional light‑hearted moments) will keep the mood varied.  
- **Platform** – Most of the content you’ve explored lives on Netflix, Amazon Prime, or documentary‑focused services (BBC iPlayer, CuriosityStream). Filtering by “Comedy,” “Documentary,” or “True Crime” on those platforms will surface the right options.

So, in short, you’d likely enjoy a **story‑driven comedy special or

### Example 3

**Question**: What should I serve for dinner this weekend with my homegrown ingredients?

**Expected Answer**: The user would prefer dinner suggestions that incorporate their homegrown cherry tomatoes and herbs like basil and mint, highlighting recipes that showcase their garden produce. They might not prefer suggestions that do not utilize these specific ingredients or do not emphasize the use of homegrown elements.

**Model's Answer**: The user would prefer dinner ideas that are healthy, vegetable‑forward, and make use of fresh homegrown produce such as mixed greens, roasted vegetables, herbs like basil and mint, and lean proteins like grilled chicken or fish, often paired with simple vinaigrette dressings or grain bases like quinoa. They would not prefer overly sweet or high‑sugar dishes, especially desserts, that do not align with a health‑focused menu.

**Why Incorrect**: The answer mentions basil and mint but omits the user's homegrown cherry tomatoes, a key personal ingredient, and adds unrelated health preferences.

**Generated Correct Answer**: **What kind of dinner you’d most enjoy — based on everything you’ve told me so far**

| Category | What you tend to gravitate toward | Why it fits your recent preferences and the fact that the ingredients are home‑grown |
|----------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Main protein** | Lightly‑grilled or pan‑seared chicken, fish (e.g., salmon or white‑fish), or a plant‑based option such as marinated tofu or tempeh | You’ve repeatedly asked for *healthy* meal ideas (mom’s 60th‑birthday dinner, quinoa‑salad lunch) and you like dishes that let the fresh vegetables shine rather than being drowned in heavy sauces. A quick‑cook protein that can be seasoned with the herbs you grow (basil, mint, maybe rosemary or thyme) keeps the meal light and lets the garden harvest be the star. |
| **Grain / starch base** | Whole‑grain quinoa, brown rice, farro, or a rustic whole‑wheat pasta | Your successful quinoa‑salad with roasted vegetables shows you already enjoy quinoa as a neutral, nutty canvas. A grain‑or‑pasta base gives you a hearty, satisfying foundation while still being nutritious and easy to scale for a family‑style dinner. |
| **Vegetable component** | A *roasted‑vegetable medley* (root veg, squash, bell peppers, carrots, zucchini) plus a *fresh herb‑infused salad* (mixed greens, cherry tomatoes, cucumber, thinly sliced radish) tossed in a simple vinaigrette | You love mixed greens with vinaigrette (multiple lunch‑idea requests) and you’ve already proven that a quinoa‑salad with roasted veg was a hit. Roasting brings out caramelized sweetness, while a crisp salad adds brightness. Using the herbs you’re growing—basil, mint, maybe a splash of lemon‑zest—will give the vinaigrette a garden‑fresh twist. |
| **Herb‑focused accent** | A *basil‑mint chimichurri* or *herb‑yogurt drizzle* that can be spooned over the protein or mixed into the grain | You asked for recipes that showcase fresh basil and mint, and you’ve harvested cherry tomatoes. A bright herb sauce (olive oil, lemon juice, minced basil, mint, a pinch of garlic, salt

### Example 4

**Question**: I've been feeling like my chocolate chip cookies need something extra. Any advice?

**Expected Answer**: The user would prefer responses that build upon their previous experimentation with turbinado sugar, suggesting ingredients or techniques that complement its richer flavor. They might not prefer generic cookie-making advice or suggestions that don't take into account their existing use of turbinado sugar.

**Model's Answer**: Here are a few tweaks that fit your love of experimenting and adding texture and deeper flavor: 1️⃣ Swap part of the butter for browned butter – it adds a nutty, caramel‑like richness that makes the cookies taste more complex. 2️⃣ Use a mix of white and light brown sugar (about ¾ white, ¼ brown) for a balance of crisp edges and chewy centers, plus a subtle molasses note. 3️⃣ Toss in toasted sliced almonds (or chopped pecans) with the dough for a pleasant crunch that complements the chocolate chips. 4️⃣ Sprinkle a pinch of flaky sea salt on each cookie just before baking to highlight the chocolate and give a sweet‑salty contrast. 5️⃣ Add a tiny dash of espresso powder (¼ tsp) to the dry ingredients – it intensifies the chocolate flavor without tasting like coffee. 6️⃣ For a surprise swirl, drizzle a little caramel or melted dark chocolate over the tops after baking. Feel free to combine a few of these ideas to create a cookie that’s uniquely yours.

**Why Incorrect**: The answer does not reference the user's prior use of turbinado sugar, providing generic advice instead of building on that personal detail.

**Generated Correct Answer**: You’ve already shown a love of experimenting in the kitchen—mixing brown‑sugar, almond flour, and sliced almonds into a cherry clafoutis, swapping flours, and thinking about texture and crunch. That same curiosity can be applied to chocolate‑chip cookies, and a few small tweaks can give you that “something extra” you’re after.

Below is a **menu of ideas** (not a final recipe) that line up with the kinds of ingredients and techniques you’ve enjoyed so far. Pick the ones that sound most appealing, combine a few, and adjust to suit your taste.

---

## 1. Flavor‑boosters  
| What it adds | Why it works (based on your past experiments) |
|--------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **Brown butter** (cook butter until it turns nutty, then cool) | Gives a deeper, caramel‑like flavor similar to the richness you got from brown sugar in the clafoutis. |
| **Espresso or instant coffee powder (½‑1 tsp)** | Enhances chocolate flavor without tasting “coffee”; the same way espresso paired with turbinado sugar lifted a carrot cake. |
| **Sea‑salt flakes (a pinch on top before baking)** | Provides a sweet‑salty contrast that makes the chocolate pop, much like a pinch of brown sugar on sliced almonds added caramel notes. |
| **Citrus zest (lemon or orange, ½ tsp)** | Adds a bright note that cuts through richness, echoing the citrus‑turbinado pairings you liked. |
| **Spice mix (cinnamon, cardamom, or a dash of smoked paprika)** | Warm spices complement chocolate and give a subtle complexity, similar to the spice‑turbinado combos you explored. |

---

## 2. Texture‑enhancers  
| Ingredient | How to use | What it does |
|------------|------------|--------------|
| **Toasted nuts (almonds, pecans, walnuts)** – thinly sliced or coarsely chopped | Toss with the dough just before the final mix, or sprinkle on top before baking | Gives the crunchy bite you loved from sliced almonds on the clafoutis. |
| **Rolled oats or oat‑flour** (¼‑½ cup) | Replace a portion of the all‑purpose flour | Adds chewiness and a heartier crumb, similar to the denser texture almond flour gave you. |
| **Coconut flakes (toasted)** | Fold in with the chips | Adds a subtle tropical crunch and a bit of caramelized flavor. |
| **Chunky chocolate or chocolate “chunks” instead of chips** | Substitute half of the chips with larger pieces | Gives pockets of molten chocolate that melt differently than standard chips. |
| **Caramelized sugar crystals (turbinado or demerara)** | Sprinkle lightly on top before baking | Provides a crunchy, caramel‑sweet crust reminiscent of the turbinado‑crust ideas you liked. |

---

## 3. Moisture & richness tweaks  
| Change | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| **Swap half the white sugar for light brown sugar** | Adds moisture and a subtle molasses note (the same effect you saw in the cherry clafoutis). |
| **Add

### Example 5

**Question**: I'm thinking of inviting my colleagues over for a small gathering. Any tips on what to bake?

**Expected Answer**: The user would prefer baking suggestions that take into account their previous success with the lemon poppyseed cake, such as variations of that recipe or other desserts that share similar qualities. They might prefer suggestions that balance impressiveness with manageability, considering their previous experience. The user may not prefer overly complex or unfamiliar recipes, or suggestions that do not build upon their existing baking experience.

**Model's Answer**: The user would prefer baked treats that highlight wholesome, flavor‑forward options such as oatmeal‑raisin cookies with nuts, lemon‑ or lavender‑infused cakes, and chewy chocolate‑chip cookies made with healthier ingredient swaps. They would not prefer overly rich, highly sweetened desserts that lack the nutritious or aromatic focus they enjoy.

**Why Incorrect**: The response does not reference the user's prior lemon poppyseed cake success or suggest variations, and adds unrelated baked goods, so it does not match the gold answer.

**Generated Correct Answer**: **What the user would likely enjoy baking for a small colleague gathering**

- **Category : Hand‑held, shareable treats**  
  The user’s past baking projects (oatmeal‑raisin‑with‑nuts cookies, chewy chocolate‑chip cookies, lemon‑poppy‑seed and lemon‑lavender pound cakes) show a clear preference for items that can be made in a batch, are easy to portion, and travel well from the kitchen to the coffee‑table.  

- **Flavor focus : Balanced sweet with a twist**  
  • *Nut‑and‑fruit‑infused cookies* – they have been experimenting with oatmeal‑raisin and nuts, and have expressed interest in adding other healthy nuts or seeds.  
  • *Lemon‑based cakes or bars* – the lemon poppy‑seed cake was a hit, and the lemon‑lavender pound cake was a recent point of excitement. A lemon‑y dessert gives a bright, refreshing note that isn’t overly heavy for a work‑day gathering.  
  • *Chocolate‑chip with chewiness* – they asked for tips on perfect chewy chocolate‑chip cookies, indicating a desire for that classic crowd‑pleaser.  

- **Health‑conscious angle : Lighter ingredient swaps**  
  The user has asked repeatedly for “healthier cookie options” (e.g., coconut‑sugar, almond‑flour, oat‑flour, coconut‑oil, egg‑free versions). When choosing a bake, they would likely gravitate toward recipes that incorporate at least one of these swaps—such as using almond flour for a gluten‑light cookie, or swapping part of the butter for coconut oil.  

- **Presentation & practicality**  
  • *Portion‑size* – bite‑size cookies or mini cake squares are ideal for a workplace setting where people will be moving around.  
  • *Storage* – they have already received detailed storage advice for cakes (room‑temperature for a few days, refrigeration if needed). They would probably want a bake that stays fresh at room temperature for the duration of the gathering.  
  • *Ease of serving* –

### Example 6

**Question**: I was thinking about rearranging the furniture in my bedroom this weekend. Any tips?

**Expected Answer**: The user would prefer responses that take into account their existing plans to replace the bedroom dresser and their interest in mid-century modern style, suggesting furniture layouts that accommodate the new dresser and incorporate elements of this design aesthetic. They might not prefer general furniture arrangement tips or suggestions that do not consider their specific design preferences.

**Model's Answer**: Here are some practical tips for rearranging the furniture in your bedroom, taking into account your love of clean, mid‑century modern lines and the zone‑based organization you’ve found helpful in the past:

1. **Define the zones** – Decide what functions each part of the room will serve. Typical zones are a sleeping area (bed), a dressing area (closet or dresser), a storage zone (nightstands, shelves) and, if you have space, a small work or reading nook.
2. **Start with the anchor** – Place the bed first, as it’s the focal point. In a mid‑century modern style a low‑profile frame with tapered legs works well. Center it on the main wall or position it opposite the door for a balanced layout.
3. **Map traffic flow** – Ensure there’s at least 2–3 ft of clear pathway between pieces so you can move around comfortably. Avoid placing furniture directly in front of the door or blocking windows.
4. **Measure and sketch** – Measure your room and each piece of furniture. Sketch a simple floor plan on paper or use a free online room‑planner app; move cut‑out shapes of your furniture around before you lift anything heavy.
5. **Keep scale in mind** – Choose pieces that suit the room’s size. Mid‑century modern furniture is often sleek and low‑profile, which helps a smaller bedroom feel spacious.
6. **Declutter first** – Before you move anything, remove items you no longer need. This reduces the amount you have to shuffle and helps you keep the space tidy.
7. **Use rugs to define zones** – A rug under the nightstands or beside a reading chair can visually separate the sleeping zone from a lounge or dressing area.
8. **Leverage vertical space** – Tall, slim shelves or wall‑mounted cabinets keep the floor clear while providing storage—perfect for a streamlined mid‑century look.
9. **Add purposeful lighting** – Pair bedside lamps (or wall‑mounted sconces) with a statement floor lamp for a reading nook. Good lighting enhances each zone’s function.
10. **Test and adjust** – Once you’ve placed the major pieces, live with the layout for a day. If a zone feels cramped or traffic feels blocked, make small tweaks—often a few inches make a big difference.

Following these steps should give you a functional, aesthetically pleasing bedroom that reflects your mid‑century modern taste while maintaining the clear, organized zones you appreciate.


**Why Incorrect**: The answer references the user's mid‑century modern style but fails to recall the user's plan to replace the bedroom dresser, so it does not fully utilize the user's personal information.

**Generated Correct Answer**: Below is a “play‑by‑play” guide that pulls together the themes that have come up in our past conversations (mid‑century‑modern style, the walnut dresser you’re building, the Wi‑Fi signal in the bedroom, and the zone‑based organization you liked for the bathroom).  
Use it as a checklist on Saturday‑Sunday so you can move, test, and fine‑tune everything without feeling rushed.

---

## 1️⃣  Start with a “paper‑or‑app” floor plan  
| Why it matters | How to do it |
|----------------|--------------|
| **Know the exact footprint** of each piece (bed, dresser, nightstand, chair, etc.) before you lift a single item. | Sketch the room on graph paper (1 sq ft = 1 square) **or** use a free phone app (RoomPlanner, Magicplan, Planner 5D). |
| **Spot traffic bottlenecks** early. | Draw the main walking routes (door → closet, bed → bathroom). Aim for at least **2‑3 ft** of clear width. |
| **Play with different layouts** without the heavy lifting. | Move the drawn pieces around until the flow feels natural. Keep the bed on the wall that will become the visual focal point (the wall you’ll look at when you first wake up). |

---

## 2️⃣  Anchor the **largest** item first – the bed  

1. **Mid‑century vibe** – choose a low‑profile frame with tapered legs (if you haven’t already).  
2. **Placement** – put the headboard against the wall that has the most visual interest (a piece of art, a statement light, or the window).  
3. **Leave breathing room** – keep at least **24‑30 in** between the side of the bed and any adjacent wall or nightstand; this makes the room feel airy, a hallmark of mid‑century design.  

*If the room feels “off‑center,” try shifting the bed 1‑2 ft toward the opposite wall; asymmetry can be a design asset when it’s intentional.*

---

## 3️⃣  Position the **walnut dresser** you’re building  

- **Function first** – the dresser should be easily reachable from the bed (for night‑time grabs) but not block the traffic lane.  
- **Balance** – if the bed is centered on one wall, place the dresser on the opposite wall or on the same wall but **offset** (e.g., a foot or two away from the corner). This creates visual equilibrium without making the room feel “split.”  
- **Hardware harmony** – you’ve chosen brass accents and simple knobs; keep the brass visible (e.g., a

### Example 7

**Question**: I've been sneezing quite a bit lately. Do you think it might be my living room?

**Expected Answer**: The user would prefer responses that consider the potential impact of their cat, Luna, and her shedding on their sneezing, as well as the recent deep clean of the living room and its possible effect on stirring up dust. They might not prefer responses that fail to take into account these specific details previously mentioned, such as generic suggestions or unrelated factors.

**Model's Answer**: It’s quite possible – dust, pet dander and other allergens that build up in a living‑room with a shedding cat can trigger sneezing. Regular vacuuming with a HEPA‑filter vacuum, damp‑dusting surfaces, washing your cat’s bedding, using an air purifier, and keeping the room decluttered can all help lower the allergen load. If your symptoms continue, consider other sources (e.g., pollen, mold, other indoor irritants) and consult a healthcare professional for a thorough evaluation.

**Why Incorrect**: The answer mentions a shedding cat and dust but fails to reference the cat's name Luna or the recent deep clean, missing key personal details the user expects.

**Generated Correct Answer**: Based on what we know about your home environment, the living‑room is a very plausible source of the sneezing you’ve been experiencing.

**Why the living‑room could be triggering your sneezes**

1. **Dust & dander buildup** – You asked for ways to keep the living‑room dust‑free while living with a cat that sheds heavily. Even with regular cleaning, cat hair, skin flakes (dander) and fine dust particles tend to accumulate on furniture, carpets, curtains and floor‑coverings. Those microscopic particles stay airborne and are classic allergy triggers that cause sneezing.

2. **Cat‑related allergens** – A shedding cat releases both hair and dander into the air. If the cat spends a lot of time in the living‑room (which most cats do), the concentration of cat allergens there will be higher than in rooms the cat visits less often.

3. **Air‑circulation factors** – If the HVAC filter or any portable air‑purifier in the living‑room hasn’t been changed recently (you were advised to change filters every 1‑3 months), allergens can recirculate throughout the space, keeping the air “sticky” for your nasal passages.

**Other possible contributors (just in case)**  
- Seasonal pollen entering through open windows or doors.  
- Mold or mildew on walls/ceilings (especially in humid climates).  
- Recent cleaning products or fragrances that can irritate the nose.  

If you haven’t noticed similar sneezing in other parts of the house, the living‑room is the most likely culprit.

**What to try next**

| Action | Why it helps | How to implement (based on your earlier dust‑control plan) |
|--------|--------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Vacuum with a HEPA filter** | Captures tiny dust and dander particles that ordinary vacuums miss. | Vacuum the carpet, rugs and upholstered furniture at least twice a week. |
| **Damp‑cloth dusting** | Prevents dust from becoming airborne. | Use a microfiber cloth lightly dampened with water (or a mild, fragrance‑free cleaner) on shelves, TV stand, picture frames, etc. |
| **Change/upgrade air filter** | Removes airborne allergens from the HVAC system. | Replace the filter now (if it’s been > 1 month) and consider a HEPA‑rated portable air purifier for the living‑room. |
| **Regular cat grooming** | Reduces the amount of hair and dander shed into the room. | Brush the cat daily (outside or in a well‑ventilated area) and keep a lint roller handy for furniture. |
| **Declutter & minimize fabric surfaces** | Fewer places for dust to settle. | Store away extra throw pillows, blankets, and decorative fabrics; choose dust‑repelling upholstery (e.g., microfiber). |
| **Keep windows closed during high pollen days** | Limits outdoor allergens from entering. | Check a local pollen forecast and keep windows shut when counts are high; use a window screen if you need ventilation. |
| **Run a dehumidifier (if humidity > 50 %)** | Reduces dust‑mite growth, which can also cause sneezing. | Place a small dehumidifier in the living‑room and keep humidity in the 40‑50 % range. |

**Quick test**  
- Spend a day (or a few hours) in another part of the house (e.g., bedroom or kitchen) with the windows closed and the HVAC off. If the sneezing eases, that further points to the living‑room environment.  
- Conversely, try a short “all‑clear” period in the living‑room after a thorough dust‑free cleaning session (vacuum, damp‑dust, filter change). If the sneezes diminish, you’ve confirmed the source.

**Bottom line**  
Given the heavy cat shedding and the dust‑control concerns you’ve previously raised, the living‑room is a strong candidate for the source of your sneezing. Implement the cleaning and air‑quality steps above, and monitor whether your symptoms improve. If they persist despite a clean living‑room

### Example 8

**Question**: I'm trying to decide whether to buy a NAS device now or wait. What do you think?

**Expected Answer**: The user would prefer responses that take into account their current home network storage capacity issues and recent reliance on external hard drives, highlighting the potential benefits of a NAS device in addressing these specific needs. They might not prefer responses that ignore their current storage challenges or fail to consider their recent tech upgrades and priorities. Preferred responses would utilize the user's previous mentions of storage capacity issues and tech investments to inform their decision.

**Model's Answer**: The user would prefer a beginner‑friendly NAS that emphasizes strong encryption and granular access control for central backup of their laptop, phone and other devices, so they would lean toward purchasing one now to address their immediate storage and security needs. They would not prefer delaying the purchase or choosing a complex, enterprise‑grade system that adds unnecessary technical complexity.

**Why Incorrect**: The answer does not mention the user's specific storage capacity issues or reliance on external hard drives, so it fails to recall and utilize the personal information described in the gold answer.

**Generated Correct Answer**: **What you should consider before deciding to buy a NAS now or wait**

1. **How urgent is the need for more storage / a central backup?**  
   - *If you’re already running out of space on your external drive or you’re worried about losing data from your laptop/phone, getting a NAS today gives you immediate protection and peace of mind.*  
   - *If you can comfortably keep using your current external drive for a few more months and you have a backup routine you trust, you have the flexibility to wait for a better price.*

2. **Security requirements**  
   - You’ve said you want strong encryption and granular access control. Most mid‑range NAS models (2‑bay or 4‑bay) already ship with AES‑256‑bit encryption, user‑level permissions, and optional two‑factor authentication.  
   - Buying now means you can set those protections up right away. Waiting doesn’t change the security features you’ll get; it only affects price and possibly newer firmware updates that arrive later.

3. **Budget & pricing cycles**  
   - **Typical sale windows** for consumer NAS hardware are around:  
     - **Black Friday / Cyber Monday** (late November)  
     - **Back‑to‑School** (July–August)  
     - **Amazon Prime Day** (mid‑July)  
   - If you’re comfortable waiting until one of those events, you could save anywhere from 10‑30 % on a 2‑bay unit and even more on higher‑bay models.  
   - If you need the device sooner, look for “refurbished” or “open‑box” units from the manufacturer’s official store; they often carry the same warranty as new units at a lower price.

4. **Future‑proofing / expansion**  
   - Think about how much data you’ll have in the next 12‑24 months. A 2‑bay NAS can be expanded later by swapping in larger drives, but a 4‑bay gives you more headroom for RAID 5/6 and additional drives without replacing the chassis.  
   - If you anticipate rapid growth (e.g., adding 4 K video archives, multiple family members’ backups, or a media‑streaming library), it may be worth buying a slightly larger unit now rather than upgrading later.

5. **Time to set up and learn**  
   - Beginner‑friendly NAS systems (Synology, QNAP, WD My Cloud) have intuitive web interfaces and mobile apps that let you get a backup running in a few hours.  
   - If you have the bandwidth now to spend a weekend configuring RAID, encryption, and backup schedules, buying today will let you start protecting data right away.  
   - If you’re still learning the concepts (RAID levels, network shares, remote access), waiting a bit while you read tutorials or watch setup videos can make the first deployment smoother.

6. **Potential new hardware releases**  
   - NAS manufacturers typically refresh their product lines once a year, often in Q2–Q3. If you’re close to a known refresh window (e.g., late

### Example 9

**Question**: I am planning another theme park weekend; do you have any suggestions?

**Expected Answer**: The user would prefer theme park suggestions that cater to their interest in both thrill rides and special events, utilizing their previous experiences at Disneyland, Knott's Berry Farm, Six Flags Magic Mountain, and Universal Studios Hollywood as a reference point. They would also appreciate recommendations that highlight unique food experiences and nighttime shows. The user might not prefer suggestions that focus solely on one aspect of theme parks, such as only thrill rides or only family-friendly attractions, and may not be interested in parks that lack special events or unique dining options.

**Model's Answer**: The user would prefer theme park experiences that focus on thrill rides, Halloween‑themed events, unique and spooky food offerings, nighttime shows, and premium VIP or behind‑the‑scenes experiences. They would not prefer generic or low‑key events without special food or seasonal theming.

**Why Incorrect**: The answer omits the user's past park visits, failing to recall personal information.

**Generated Correct Answer**: **What kind of suggestions the user would prefer for a theme‑park weekend**

- **New or upgraded thrill attractions** – The user has already visited the major Southern‑California parks (Disneyland, Knott’s Berry Farm, Six Flags Magic Mountain, Universal Studios Hollywood) and is looking for fresh, high‑adrenaline rides that they haven’t experienced yet. They would enjoy parks that have recently opened or are about to debut a coaster, launch‑type ride, or immersive dark‑ride that pushes the thrill factor.

- **Seasonal or holiday‑themed events** – Their recent interest in Halloween‑time festivities (e.g., “Halloween Time” at Disneyland, “Knott’s Scary Farm,” “Fright Fest,” “Halloween Horror Nights”) shows they like events that transform a park with decorations, scare zones, and special entertainment. They would be drawn to parks that are currently running or will soon run a themed celebration (Halloween, holiday lights, summer festivals) with a strong emphasis on atmosphere.

- **Unique, limited‑time food experiences** – The user asked specifically about “must‑try” Halloween‑themed menu items and exclusive dining options. They would appreciate suggestions that highlight:
  * specialty items that are only available during the event (e.g., pumpkin‑spiced beignets, “Mummy Dogs,” “Zombie Brain Cupcakes”);
  * pop‑up or themed restaurants that serve a full Halloween‑or‑holiday menu;
  * gourmet or VIP‑only dining experiences (such as the Universal Studios Hollywood Gourmet Buffet) that pair food with the event’s theme.

- **Nighttime spectaculars and shows** – They expressed interest in “nighttime shows,” so they would like parks that

## Prompt Improvement Analysis

**1️⃣  QUICK ANALYSIS OF WHAT WENT WRONG**

| Symptom | Why it happened (root cause) |
|--------|------------------------------|
| The model **adds unrelated topics** (e.g., brain‑computer‑interface, other genres, health‑focused advice). | The prompt never tells the model to *exclude* any information that is **not** explicitly present in the retrieved memories. It only says “use the context”, but the model still “fills‑in” what it thinks is plausible. |
| The answer **misses a key personal detail** (e.g., cherry‑tomatoes, cat name *Luna*, the new dresser). | There is no explicit instruction to *search the whole memory list for every concrete entity* and to *surface every entity that appears in the question or in the memories*. |
| The model sometimes **mixes several preference streams** without signalling which belong together, or it gives a single “generic” recommendation. | The prompt does not require the model to *group* preferences, to *rank* them by recency, or to *state the evidence* for each stream. |
| For “single‑session‑preference” questions the model is asked to *describe the kind of thing the user would like*, but the prompt still says “Answer must be comprehensive and plenty of details”. The model therefore treats the task like a normal factual answer and forgets the “describe‑only‑the‑preference” format. | The guideline for recommendation‑type questions is “DO NOT give actual recommendations – describe the kind”. However the surrounding “Answer must be comprehensive” overrides it, and the model still tries to list concrete titles, venues, etc. |
| The model sometimes **over‑generalises** (e.g., “healthy‑focused” when the user never mentioned health). | No rule forces the model to *stay within the scope of the retrieved memories* and to *avoid adding inferred traits* unless they are explicitly supported. |

**Take‑away:**  
We need **explicit, step‑by‑step guidance** that forces the model to:

1. **Extract every concrete user‑specific entity** (ingredients, pet name, product, event, etc.) from the memories.  
2. **Group memories by topic and by recency** (most recent = strongest preference).  
3. **Only ever mention things that appear in the memories** (or the question itself). If something is missing, say so.  
4. **For “single‑session‑preference”** questions, output a *structured “What kind of … would you prefer”* block and **never list actual titles, movies, products, etc.**  
5. **When multiple preference streams exist**, list them separately with a short justification drawn from the memories.  
6. Keep the existing rules for quantitative, comparative, time‑date, etc., unchanged.

---

**2️⃣  SPECIFIC PROMPT REVISIONS**

Below are the concrete additions / modifications that address the root causes while staying compatible with the other categories.

| # | Change | Reason |
|---|--------|--------|
| A | **Add a “Memory‑Scanning” step** that tells the model to *first list every concrete entity* (people, pets, objects, topics, dates, numbers) that appears in any retrieved chunk. | Guarantees the model sees the cherry‑tomatoes, Luna, the dresser, etc., before it starts reasoning. |
| B | **Introduce a “Relevance Filter”**: *Only use facts that are explicitly present in the memories or the question.* If a fact is not present, the model must say “I don’t have information about …”. | Stops hallucination of unrelated topics. |
| C | **Separate handling for “preference / recommendation” questions** with a mandatory output template: <br>```\n**What kind of <category> you’d likely enjoy**\n| Area of interest | What you would prefer (typical venues, formats, attributes) |\n| … | … |\n``` | Gives the model a clear format that matches the gold answers and prevents it from giving concrete titles. |
| D | **Add a “Recency Weighting” rule**: *When multiple memories address the same topic, give priority to the most recent one, but still mention older memories as “previously expressed interest”.* | Ensures the model respects the “most recent memory updates facts” rule without discarding useful background. |
| E | **Explicit “No extra inference” clause**: *Do not add traits, preferences, or constraints that are not directly stated in the memories.* | Prevents the model from inventing “health‑focused” or “general AI” preferences. |
| F | **Clarify that the “comprehensive” requirement applies only to factual/quantitative answers**; for preference answers the model should be *concise but complete* within the structured table. | Keeps good performance on other categories while relaxing verbosity for preference tasks. |
| G | **Add a “Check‑list before output”**: <br>1. Did I mention every concrete entity from the memories? <br>2. Did I stay within the scope of the memories? <br>3. Did I use the correct output format for the question type? | A cheap “self‑audit” that catches most slip‑ups. |

All other existing rules (counting, location, comparative, date‑calc, etc.) stay exactly as they are.

### Best Performing Prompt
```
You are a helpful assistant that must answer user questions based on the previous conversations.

{context_instructions}**Answer Guidelines:**
1. Start by scanning retrieved context to understand the facts and events that happened and the timeline.
2. Reason about all the memories and find the right answer, considering the most recent memory as an update of the current facts.
3. If you have 2 possible answers, just say both.

In general the answer must be comprehensive and plenty of details from the retrieved context.

For quantitative/counting questions ("how many..."): First list each unique item in your reasoning (1. X, 2. Y, 3. Z...), scanning ALL facts, then count them for your answer.
If questions asks a location (where...?) make sure to include the location name.
For recommendation questions ("can you recommend...", "suggest...", "any tips..."): DO NOT give actual recommendations. Instead, describe what KIND the user would prefer based on their context. Example answer format: "The user would prefer recommendations for [category] that focus on [their interest]. They would not prefer [what to avoid based on context]."
For questions asking for help or instructions, consider the users' recent memories and previous interactions with the assistant to understand their current situation better (recent purchases, specific product models used..)
For specific number/value questions, use the context to understand what is the most up-to-date number based on recency, but also include the reasoning (in the answer) on previous possible values and why you think are less relevant.
For open questions, include as much details as possible from different sources that are relevant.
For questions where a specific entity/role is mentioned and it's different from your memory, just say the truth, don't make up anything just to fulfill the question. For example, if the question is about a specific sport, you should consider if the memories and the question are about the same sport. (e.g. american football vs soccer, shows vs podcasts)
For comparative questions, say you don't know the answer if you don't have information about both sides. (or more sides)
For questions related to time/date, carefully review the question date and the memories date to correctly answer the question.
For questions related to time/date calculation (e.g. How many days passed between X and Y?), carefully review the memories date to correctly answer the question and only provide an answer if you have information about both X and Y, otherwise say it's not possible to calculate and why.

Consider assistant's previous actions (e.g., bookings, reminders) as impactful to the user experiences.

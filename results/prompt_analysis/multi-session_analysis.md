### Example 4

**Question**: How many hours in total did I spend driving to my three road trip destinations combined?

**Expected Answer**: 15 hours for getting to the three destinations (or 30 hours for the round trip)

**Model's Answer**: You spent about 17–18 hours driving in total: 6 hours to Washington D.C., 4 hours to the Outer Banks, and roughly 7–8 hours to Tybee Island.

**Why Incorrect**: The model's total driving time (17–18 hours) does not match the correct total of 15 hours (or 30 for round trip).

**Generated Correct Answer**: **Possible sets of three road‑trip destinations and the total driving time for each set**

| # | Destination (as described in the memories) | Driving time mentioned |
|---|--------------------------------------------|------------------------|
| 1 | Washington D.C. (a “great experience driving for six hours”) | **6 hours** |
| 2 | Outer Banks, NC (the user says the trip “only took four hours to drive there”) | **4 hours** |
| 3 | Tennessee mountains (the user says they “drove for five hours to reach the location”) | **5 hours** |

**Total driving time for this set:** 6 h + 4 h + 5 h = **15 hours**.

---

**Another plausible interpretation**

If the user is counting the drive from the Outer Banks to Tybee Island as one of the three destination legs (the only other explicit multi‑hour drive in the records), the three trips could be:

| # | Destination (as described) | Driving time mentioned |
|---|----------------------------|------------------------|
| 1 | Washington D.C. – 6 hours |
| 2 | Outer Banks, NC – 4 hours |
| 3 | Outer Banks → Tybee Island – 7‑8 hours (the assistant notes “about 7‑8 hours depending on traffic and route”) |

**Total driving time for this set:** 6 h + 4 h + ≈ 7.5 h ≈ **17.5 hours** (rounded to the midpoint of the 7‑8 hour range).

---

**So, depending on which three trips you’re counting, the combined driving time is either:**

* **15 hours** (Washington D.C., Outer Banks, Tennessee mountains) **or**  
* **≈ 17.5 hours** (Washington D.C., Outer Banks, drive from Outer Banks to Tybee Island).

### Example 8

**Question**: How many properties did I view before making an offer on the townhouse in the Brookside neighborhood?

**Expected Answer**: I viewed four properties before making an offer on the townhouse in the Brookside neighborhood. The reasons I didn't make an offer on them were: the kitchen of the bungalow needed serious renovation, the property in Cedar Creek was out of my budget, the noise from the highway was a deal-breaker for the 1-bedroom condo, and my offer on the 2-bedroom condo was rejected due to a higher bid.

**Model's Answer**: You viewed 1 property before making the offer.

**Why Incorrect**: The model says 1 property, but the correct answer is 4 properties.

### Example 9

**Question**: How many hours of jogging and yoga did I do last week?

**Expected Answer**: 0.5 hours

**Model's Answer**: You didn't record any jogging or yoga sessions for the week of May 23–May 29 2023, so the total is 0 hours of jogging and 0 hours of yoga. The only jog we have on record is a 30‑minute jog on May 20, which falls outside of that week, and there are no logs of any yoga sessions.

**Why Incorrect**: The model states 0 hours of jogging and yoga, but the correct answer is 0.5 hours, so the response is incorrect.

## Prompt Improvement Analysis

**1. Brief analysis of the failure patterns**

| Pattern | What went wrong | Why the current prompt didn’t stop it |
|---------|----------------|--------------------------------------|
| **Under‑ or over‑counting** (examples 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 9) | The model skimmed the memories, missed one or more relevant events, or counted the same event twice. | The prompt only says “list each unique item … then count them”, but it never forces the model to *show* the list, to *cite* the memory source, or to *verify* that every relevant memory has been considered. |
| **Missing temporal filtering** (examples 3, 4, 5, 9) | The model ignored the required time window (last month, past two weeks, day before appointment). | No explicit instruction to extract the date from each memory, compare it with the window, and discard out‑of‑range items. |
| **Confusing similar entities** (examples 2, 6, 8, 10) | The model mixed up projects, citrus fruits, viewed properties, or grocery stores because it did not check that the entity mentioned in the question matches the entity in the memory. | The prompt mentions “be careful with different sports/ shows vs podcasts”, but it does not give a systematic “match‑question‑entity → memory‑entity” step. |
| **Hallucinating or guessing** (examples 5, 10) | When the model thought the answer was unknown it either said “I don’t know” or guessed a wrong store. | The prompt tells the model to say “I don’t know” only when information is missing, but the model often *thinks* information is missing because it never performed a full cross‑check of all memories. |
| **Multi‑session aggregation** (all examples) | The model treated each memory in isolation instead of aggregating across sessions, leading to incomplete totals. | No explicit guidance that “multi‑session” questions require *union* of facts from *all* retrieved memories, respecting recency and time windows. |
| **Lack of a clear answer format** | The model sometimes gave a narrative without a concise final count, making it hard to see the answer. | The prompt never asks for a “final answer line” that isolates the number or value. |

**Root cause:** the prompt does not force a *structured, step‑by‑step* reasoning process that (a) extracts every relevant fact, (b) timestamps it, (c) checks that it matches the asked‑for entity, (d) de‑duplicates, and (e) presents a clean final answer. Without that scaffolding the model can skip items, double‑count, or give up.

---

**2. Specific recommended changes**

| Area | Current wording | New instruction (what to add / replace) |
|------|----------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Overall workflow** | “Start by scanning retrieved context … Reason about all the memories …” | **Add a mandatory 5‑step checklist** (extract, timestamp, filter, deduplicate, count). |
| **Quantitative / counting questions** | “First list each unique item … then count them” | **Require the list to be *explicitly numbered* and *cite the memory source* (e.g., “1. Boots – Memory 3”). |
| **Temporal windows** | “For quantitative/counting questions … scanning ALL facts” | **Add:** “If the question mentions a time span (last month, past two weeks, day before X, etc.), keep only items whose date falls inside that span. Discard everything else and note the filter step.” |
| **Entity matching** | “For questions where a specific entity/role is mentioned … just say the truth” | **Add:** “First identify the exact entity the question asks about (e.g., ‘projects’, ‘citrus fruits’, ‘properties’). Then, from every memory, extract only those items that belong to that entity class. Ignore memories about other entities even if they look similar.” |
| **Recency handling** | “consider the most recent memory as an update of the current facts” | **Add:** “When two memories refer to the same item but give different values, keep the value from the *most recent* memory (by its timestamp). Explicitly note the replacement.” |
| **Multi‑session aggregation** | No dedicated rule | **Add a dedicated bullet:** “For any question that asks ‘how many’, ‘total’, ‘combined’, etc., you must aggregate across *all* sessions. Treat each memory as an independent record, then union them after de‑duplication.” |
| **Answer format** | “Answer:” | **Add:** “**Final Answer:** <concise value or short sentence>. Anything before that may be reasoning, but the final answer line must contain the answer alone.” |
| **When information is insufficient** | “say you don’t know” | **Refine:** “If after the full checklist you still lack any required piece (e.g., a date, a count), respond with ‘I don’t have enough information to answer X because …’ instead of guessing.” |
| **Avoid hallucination** | Implicit | **Add:** “Never invent a number, date, or entity that does not appear verbatim (or can be directly inferred) in the retrieved memories.” |
| **Explicit source citation** | None | **Add:** “When you list an item, append the memory tag (Memory 1, Memory 2, …) so the evaluator can see where it came from.” |
| **Quantitative reasoning style** | “list each unique item … then count them” | **Add a template** for counting: <br>1️⃣ Extract → <br>2️⃣ Timestamp → <br>3️⃣ Filter → <br>4️⃣ Deduplicate → <br>5️⃣ Count → <br>6️⃣ Final Answer. |

These changes directly address the observed failures while staying generic enough for other categories (recommendations, open‑ended, instructions, etc.) because they only tighten the reasoning process; they do not remove any existing helpful guidance.

**3. Improved benchmark prompt**  

*The parts that have been added or changed are highlighted in **bold** and marked with **[NEW]**.*

```
You are a helpful assistant that must answer user questions based on the previous conversations.

{context_instructions}

**Answer Guidelines:**

1. **[NEW] Structured Reasoning Checklist**  
   For every question follow these steps **in order** and **show each step** in your response:

   a. **Identify the target entity / metric** (e.g., “projects”, “plants”, “driving hours”).  
   b. **Extract every relevant fact** from the retrieved memories.  
      - Write each fact on its own line, **numbered**, and **cite the memory source** (Memory 1, Memory 2, …).  
   c. **Timestamp each fact** (use the date that appears in the memory; if none is given, note “date unknown”).  
   d. **Apply any temporal filter** required by the question (e.g., “last month”, “past two weeks”, “the day before the doctor’s appointment”). Keep only facts whose timestamps satisfy the window and explicitly state the filter result.  
   e. **Deduplicate / resolve conflicts**: if the same item appears in multiple memories with different values, keep the value from the **most recent** memory (by timestamp) and note the replacement.  
   f. **Count / aggregate** the remaining items (or sum durations, distances, amounts, etc.). Show the arithmetic you performed.  

2. **Quantitative / counting questions**  
   - First list each unique item **as described in step 1b** (including the memory tag).  
   - Then write the total count or sum on a separate line.  

3. **Temporal questions**  
   - Always compare the **question date** (`{formatted_question_date}`) with the dates in the memories.  
   - If the question asks for “the day before X”, compute the exact date and use it for filtering.  

4. **Entity‑matching rule**

### Best Performing Prompt
```
You are a helpful assistant that must answer user questions based on the previous conversations.

{context_instructions}**Answer Guidelines:**
1. Start by scanning retrieved context to understand the facts and events that happened and the timeline.
2. Reason about all the memories and find the right answer, considering the most recent memory as an update of the current facts.
3. If you have 2 possible answers, just say both.

In general the answer must be comprehensive and plenty of details from the retrieved context.

For quantitative/counting questions ("how many..."): First list each unique item in your reasoning (1. X, 2. Y, 3. Z...), scanning ALL facts, then count them for your answer.
If questions asks a location (where...?) make sure to include the location name.
For recommendation questions ("can you recommend...", "suggest...", "any tips..."): DO NOT give actual recommendations. Instead, describe what KIND the user would prefer based on their context. Example answer format: "The user would prefer recommendations for [category] that focus on [their interest]. They would not prefer [what to avoid based on context]."
For questions asking for help or instructions, consider the users' recent memories and previous interactions with the assistant to understand their current situation better (recent purchases, specific product models used..)
For specific number/value questions, use the context to understand what is the most up-to-date number based on recency, but also include the reasoning (in the answer) on previous possible values and why you think are less relevant.
For open questions, include as much details as possible from different sources that are relevant.
For questions where a specific entity/role is mentioned and it's different from your memory, just say the truth, don't make up anything just to fulfill the question. For example, if the question is about a specific sport, you should consider if the memories and the question are about the same sport. (e.g. american football vs soccer, shows vs podcasts)
For comparative questions, say you don't know the answer if you don't have information about both sides. (or more sides)
For questions related to time/date, carefully review the question date and the memories date to correctly answer the question.
For questions related to time/date calculation (e.g. How many days passed between X and Y?), carefully review the memories date to correctly answer the question and only provide an answer if you have information about both X and Y, otherwise say it's not possible to calculate and why.

Consider assistant's previous actions (e.g., bookings, reminders) as impactful to the user experiences.
